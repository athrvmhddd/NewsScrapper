Nearly a quarter of widespread attacks were zero-day attacks where a single adversary compromised dozens to hundreds of organizations simultaneously.

            "{'Title': 'Streamlined Security Solutions: PAM for Small to Medium-sized Businesses', 'Article Text': 'Today, all organizations are exposed to the threat of cyber breaches, irrespective of their scale. Historically, larger companies were frequent targets due to their substantial resources, sensitive data, and regulatory responsibilities, whereas smaller entities often underestimated their attractiveness to hackers. However, this assumption is precarious, as cybercriminals frequently exploit perceived vulnerabilities in smaller firms for expedient profit.\\n\\nSmall to medium-sized organizations often lack the resources and expertise for robust privileged identity management. Yet they increasingly require PAM solutions. Fortunately, the market now offers numerous vendors specializing in these needs. Recognizing the demand for accessible solutions, these vendors provide affordable options tailored to organizations aiming to meet stringent compliance standards or enhance security practices, requiring minimal installation and maintenance to gain full access controls.\\n\\nTo enhance threat awareness, many organizations train employees to identify phishing attacks. Extending this proactive approach to protect corporate assets is essential. A PAM tool defends against both external and internal threats. Despite concerns about fostering a surveillance culture, the primary goal is protection.\\n\\nImplementing a PAM solution demonstrates trust in your IT team, providing a safety net to exonerate them from suspicion in case of questionable activities, proving actions were neither malicious nor their own.\\n\\nWhat does a PAM solution offer small to medium-sized organizations?\\n\\nThe following are cybersecurity functions offered by a PAM solution:\\n\\nCredential management to secure storage and management of privileged credentials, preventing insecure sharing and unauthorized access. Seamless integration simplicity, security and compliance effortlessly. Comprehensive protection to control access to critical systems and sensitive information, reducing the risk of unauthorized access. Regulatory compliance offers the necessary controls and audit trails for privileged access, helping meet stringent requirements such as GDPR, HIPAA or PCI DSS. Insider threat mitigation to minimize the risk of internal abuse or data theft.\\n\\nHow small to medium-sized organizations can simplify the implementation and management of a PAM solution?\\n\\nSmall to medium-sized organizations do not need all the complex and convoluted setup required for a traditional PAM solution. This is why One Identity developed a PAM solution that caters specifically to small to medium-sized organizations, allowing businesses of any size to utilize session monitoring and recording, logging all activities carried out with privileged accounts to facilitate forensic analysis during security incidents.\\n\\nOffering a SaaS solution ensures quick implementation, allowing organizations to establish robust privileged access management without significant delays. Additionally, this approach promotes cost-efficiency through a subscription-based model, reducing upfront costs and eliminating the need for substantial investments in hardware or dedicated personnel.\\n\\nConclusion\\n\\nDeploying a PAM solution for small to medium-sized enterprises is now straightforward. With accessible, affordable, and scalable options available, organizations can protect critical assets from external threats and insider risks effectively. By adopting proactive security measures and modern PAM technologies, these enterprises can ensure data protection, regulatory compliance, and operational continuity without undue complexity or resource strain.', 'Article Summary': 'Small to medium-sized organizations often lack the resources and expertise for robust privileged identity management.\\nWhat does a PAM solution offer small to medium-sized organizations?\\nHow small to medium-sized organizations can simplify the implementation and management of a PAM solution?\\nSmall to medium-sized organizations do not need all the complex and convoluted setup required for a traditional PAM solution.\\nConclusionDeploying a PAM solution for small to medium-sized enterprises is now straightforward.', 'Summary 2.0': 'This is a summary of the text.', 'Article Keywords': ['streamlined', 'mediumsized', 'compliance', 'businesses', 'small', 'organizations', 'security', 'management', 'pam', 'solution', 'privileged', 'access', 'solutions'], 'Language': 'en'}\n",

Every CISO knows that cybersecurity is an increasingly hot topic for executives and board members alike. And when the inevitable CISO/Board briefing rolls around, everyone wants answers: Are we safe from attacks? Are we making progress? Could <insert name of CVE or incident that keeps you up at night here> happen to us?\\n\\nThese are all fair concerns.\\n\\nThe question is, how do we best answer them? A company board deserves clear, concise information tied to business goals, not technical details about fixes or attack methods. A communication gap between the CISO and the board can lead to misunderstandings, increased risk, and potentially devastating cyberattacks. And this is why one of the overriding challenges for CISOs today remains: How to present risk in a way that the board can understand and leverage to make informed decisions?\\n\\nCheck out XM Cyber's new eBook, A CISO's Guide to Reporting Risk to the Board. It's packed with strategies and tips to help you finally answer board questions about risk with confidence and accuracy. By establishing a plan for clear communication and measurable progress, CISOs can finally build boardroom trust and secure the resources needed to effectively manage cyber risks.\\n\\nThe Numbers Speak\\n\\nDespite this clear and pressing need for communication, recent research by Heidrick and Struggles, leading executive search, and corporate culture consulting services, revealed a worrying disconnect between CISOs and CEOs. Only 5% of CISOs report directly to the CEO, indicating a potential lack of high-level influence, and 2⁄3 's of CISOs are two levels down from the CEO in the reporting structure.\\n\\nThis means the majority of cybersecurity leaders remain several steps removed from organizational decision-making. The Ponemon Institute study also found that only 37% of organizations think they effectively utilize their CISO's expertise. Research from Gartner highlights a similar trend: only 10% of boards currently have a dedicated cybersecurity committee overseen by a board member.\\n\\nThese numbers expose significant weaknesses in how organizations structure reporting and how boards receive briefings. Despite a more direct role for CISOs, the challenge of translating risk into clear business terms persists.\\n\\nThe Questions\\n\\nAs a CISO, asking yourself these five key questions can help you bridge the board/executive communication gap, present a clear picture of cybersecurity posture, and gain the support needed to effectively manage risk:\\n\\n1. How do I justify my cybersecurity budget?\\n\\nCISOs understand that strong cybersecurity requires ongoing investment. Without a clear justification, your budget requests are at risk of reduction or outright rejection. So, prove that your goals are not only achievable but worthy by demonstrating the return on investment in cybersecurity. Show naysayers that by securing resources to safeguard critical data and infrastructure, you are ultimately protecting the organization's financial health.\\n\\n2. How do I master the art of risk reporting?\\n\\nMastering risk reporting is critical if you want to shift executive perception of cybersecurity. Non-technical audiences struggle with complex security threats. That's why your reports need to be clear and data-driven. They need to quantify risks in business terms, highlighting potential financial losses from breaches. This way, you demonstrate the value of security investments in protecting the organization's financial well-being – shifting cybersecurity from a cost center to a business enabler.\\n\\n3. How do I celebrate security achievements?\\n\\nDon't focus just on problems; celebrating security wins is crucial. Recognizing your team's successes boosts organizational morale, fosters a culture of security awareness, and highlights the value of cybersecurity investments. Public recognition of attacks that were deflected can simultaneously deter attackers and reassure stakeholders of the organization's commitment to data protection.\\n\\n4. How do I collaborate with other teams better?\\n\\nEffective CISOs understand that cybersecurity isn't a solo endeavor. Strong security relies on a company-wide commitment to vigilance. That's why collaboration with other departments like IT, HR, and Legal is essential. By working together, CISOs can integrate security awareness training into employee onboarding and development programs. What's more, your collaborative efforts can lead to clearer security policies that align with business processes. And collaboration strengthens incident response protocols, ensuring a swift and coordinated response to security breaches.\\n\\n5. How do I focus on what matters most?\\n\\nCISOs are bombarded with threats and tasks. Prioritization is key. Focusing on what truly matters ensures resources are directed effectively. This means identifying the most critical security risks, aligning them with your organization's business goals, and addressing them strategically. By saying no to distractions and focusing on high-impact initiatives, you can optimize security posture and maximize your organization's overall resilience.\\n\\nBridging the Gap: Effective Communication for CISOs\\n\\nThe rising tide of cyberattacks demands clear communication between CISOs and boards. To bridge this gap and gain crucial support, CISOs should prioritize effective risk communication. Ditch the technical jargon and translate complex threats into business terms. Highlight the financial impact of cyberattacks, potential reputational damage, and disruptions to core operations. By framing cybersecurity as a business issue, CISOs can secure buy-in from the board for essential security investments. (Check out this great article for more tips on how to get executive buy-in for security initiatives here.)\\n\\nAdditionally, remember that communication goes beyond simply presenting problems. CISOs should also demonstrate progress and move away from basic metrics to develop data-driven reports that showcase the effectiveness of security investments. Key metrics should be tracked, such as reductions in successful attacks or the time taken to identify and contain breaches. These demonstrable data points will help drive your message home.\\n\\nCheck out XM Cyber's new eBook, A CISO's Guide to Reporting Risk to the Board.

            "{'Title': 'Smash-and-Grab Extortion', 'Article Text': 'The Problem\\n\\nThe \"2024 Attack Intelligence Report\" from the staff at Rapid7 [1] is a well-researched, well-written report that is worthy of careful study. Some key takeaways are:\\n\\n53% of the over 30 new vulnerabilities that were widely exploited in 2023 and at the start of 2024 were zero-days. More mass compromise events arose from zero-day vulnerabilities than from n-day vulnerabilities. Nearly a quarter of widespread attacks were zero-day attacks where a single adversary compromised dozens to hundreds of organizations simultaneously. Attackers are moving from initial access to exploitation in minutes or hours rather than days or weeks.\\n\\nSo the conventional patch and put strategy is as effective as a firetruck showing up after a building has burned to the ground! Of course, patch and put could prevent future attacks, but taking into account that patch development takes from days to weeks [2] and that the average time to apply critical patches is 16 days [3], devices are vulnerable for a long time after the zero-day has become public knowledge. This allows smaller actors to get their share of the meat, much like the vultures they are. In view of Rapid7\\'s report, something different must be done to protect IoT and other vulnerable devices.\\n\\nHow Firmware Comes To Be\\n\\n\"Software Bills of Materials for IoT and OT devices\" by IoTSF is another excellent read. I was surprised to learn that \"Modern software is rarely created from scratch but rather it integrates a relatively small amount of new code with tens, hundreds, or even thousands of pre-existing components …\". In the old days (circa 2015) we wrote our own firmware, but not anymore. Now, according to the authors, IoT firmware is assembled from mostly open source components that are riddled with vulnerabilities. This is not a step forward for device security!\\n\\nAccording to the IoTSF authors, components bring in more components, each with more vulnerabilities. Also according to them, creating accurate SBOMs is difficult, and identifying all of the vulnerabilities in an SBOM is even more difficult. So security teams are faced with inadequate SBOMs and the task of deciding which vulnerabilities are exploitable, then fixing those vulnerabilities. According to other reports, the number of vulnerabilities and the complexity of IoT firmware are growing rapidly year by year. Keeping up with patches seems to be a hopeless treadmill. No wonder security teams are getting burned out.\\n\\nChilling Exploits\\n\\nZero-days are especially concerning because many state actors have inventories of them that are ready to be used as weapons [4]. We tend to think of exploits as data exfiltrations or ransomware attacks. However, these are not the whole story. In 2007 at Idaho National Laboratory it was decided to test if malware could damage a full-size electricity generator [5]. The malware controlled a relay that connected or disconnected the generator from the power grid. By exercising a sequence of connects and disconnects, the malware was able to cause the generator to destroy itself.\\n\\nThe result was not repairable damage, but rather scrap metal that could only be melted down to manufacture a new generator. The generator was destroyed in under a minute. Thus malware running on a tiny MCU was able to destroy a large machine. What if a bad actor could destroy 10% of the electricity generators in the U.S.? How long would it take to manufacture and install replacement generators? What would happen in the meantime?\\n\\nWe Need a Better Solution\\n\\nWe must recognize that patching and putting is not sufficient to deal with emerging new threats and the weaponized threats detailed above.\\n\\nIsolating vulnerable firmware is the better solution. This is amply demonstrated by Green Hills\\'s Integrity for aerospace, BlackBerry\\'s QNX for automotive, and several \"separation kernels\" by other companies. However, the problem with these solutions is that they require power-hungry processors, and isolation is at the process level using memory management units (MMUs). IoT devices generally require low-power microcontrollers (MCUs), their firmware is normally comprised of but a single process and they are limited to memory protection units (MPUs). What is needed is more granular isolation (i.e. at the task level) that works for MCUs.\\n\\nWe Have Such a Solution\\n\\nWe have demonstrated that isolated partitioning is practical for Cortex-M based MCUs (which comprise about 80% of all MCUs in production). In addition, the pmode barrier provided by this architecture provides additional protection for mission-critical and other trusted code. Such code needs only minimal modification for partitioning. The following figure illustrates the basics of Cortex-M partitioning and how it fits into the overall security picture:\\n\\nAs shown, mission-critical firmware, security firmware, and handler mode (hmode) firmware are protected by the pmode barrier and run in privileged mode (pmode) or hmode. Vulnerable application firmware, SOUP, and middleware are above the pmode barrier and run in unprivileged mode (umode). Firmware in umode can access pmode or hmode only via exceptions caused by faults or via the SVC exception, which is used for system service calls. The pmode barrier is enforced by hardware and thus it is impenetrable from umode.\\n\\nAs shown in the figure, umode firmware is divided into isolated partitions. If a hacker penetrates one umode partition, he cannot access data or code in other partitions. Communication between partitions is via portals, which preserve isolation. As a consequence a hacker may disable the functionality of one umode partition, but not others. In addition, pmode and umode code are doubly-protected by the pmode barrier. Thus the device is able to continue performing its primary functions and most secondary functions when attacked. During an attack, the breached partition can be stopped, the malware exorcised, and the partition rebooted to resume normal operation.\\n\\nIt should be noted that isolated partitioning is as effective against zero-days as it is against unpatched vulnerabilities. It doesn\\'t matter how the attacker got into the partition; he is sandboxed. In addition, partitioning enables siloing, which can mitigate insider threats (another growing attack vector), and provides hardware enforcement of certain good programming practices, which might lead to more on-time deliveries!\\n\\nFor those interested, we have posted demos and an ebook at www.smxrtos.com/securesmx.

            "{'Title': 'Blueprint for Success: Implementing a CTEM Operation', 'Article Text': 'The attack surface isn\\'t what it once was and it\\'s becoming a nightmare to protect. A constantly expanding and evolving attack surface means risk to the business has skyrocketed and current security measures are struggling to keep it protected. If you\\'ve clicked on this article, there\\'s a good chance you\\'re looking for solutions to manage this risk.\\n\\nIn 2022, a new framework was coined by Gartner to address these challenges - Continuous Threat Exposure Management (CTEM). Since then, putting this framework into action has become a priority across many organizations for the profound improvement it is expected to make toward maintaining a high level of security readiness and resilience.\\n\\n\"By 2026 organizations that prioritize their security investments based on a continuous exposure management program will be three times less likely to suffer a breach.\" Gartner, \"How to Manage Cybersecurity Threats, Not Episodes,\" August 21, 2023\\n\\nCTEM provides a continuous and comprehensive view of the attack surface and the exposures within it, testing whether security controls are effectively blocking the potential exploitation of exposures, and then streamlining the mobilization towards remediating the selected vulnerabilities.\\n\\nAdopting CTEM can quickly become overwhelming as it involves the orchestration of many disparate and moving parts. Pulling together digital assets, workloads, networks, identities, and data across the enterprise. Therefore to simplify this, we have broken down the framework to its pillars, providing manageable steps that guide you through this process of making exposure management - manageable.\\n\\nPillar #1: Expand your Visibility of the Attack Surface\\n\\nA primary challenge with asset management is its limited scope. It provides only a sectioned view of the attack surface typically concentrating solely on on-premise vulnerabilities, with no scope for actioning the vulnerability data it generates.\\n\\nCTEM provides greater visibility into all types of exposures across the attack surface - internal, external, and cloud - to help organizations better understand their real security risk profile.\\n\\nThe process starts by scoping the environment for digital assets in stages. We recommend an initial scope that includes either:\\n\\nThe external attack surface, which tends to have a smaller scope and is supported by a growing ecosystem of tools. SaaS tooling, which lends itself to easier communication about risks, as SaaS solutions tend to increasingly host critical business data.\\n\\nAt a second stage, consider expanding the scope to include digital risk protection, which adds greater visibility into the attack surface.\\n\\nOnce the scope is determined, organizations should determine their risk profiles by discovering exposures on high-priority assets. It should also incorporate the misconfiguration of assets, especially as they relate to security controls, and other weaknesses, such as counterfeit assets or poor responses to phishing tests.\\n\\nPillar #2: Level up your Vulnerability Management\\n\\nVulnerability Management (VM) has long been the cornerstone of many organizations\\' cybersecurity strategies, focusing on identifying and patching against known CVEs. However, with the growing complexity of the IT environment and the enhanced capabilities of threat actors, VM alone is no longer enough to maintain the cybersecurity posture of the enterprise.\\n\\nThis is particularly evident when taking into account the escalating number of published CVEs each year. Last year alone, there were 29,085 CVEs and only 2-7% of these were ever exploited in the wild. This makes becoming patch-perfect an unrealistic goal, especially as this doesn\\'t take into account non-patchable vulnerabilities such as misconfigurations, Active Directory issues, unsupported third-party software, stolen and leaked credentials and more, which will account for over 50% of enterprise exposures by 2026.\\n\\nCTEM shifts the focus to prioritizing exposures based on their exploitability and their risk impact on critical assets as opposed to CVSS scores, chronology, or vendor scoring. This ensures that the most sensitive digital assets to the organization\\'s continuity and objectives are addressed first.\\n\\nPrioritization is therefore based on security gaps that are easily exploitable and simultaneously provide access to sensitive digital assets. The combination of both causes these exposures, which typically represent a fraction of all discovered exposures, to be prioritized.\\n\\nPillar #3 Validation Converts CTEM from theory to proven strategy\\n\\nThe final pillar of the CTEM strategy, validation, is the mechanism to prevent the exploitation of security gaps. To ensure the ongoing efficacy of security controls, validation needs to be offensive in nature, by emulating attacker methods.\\n\\nThere are four strategies for testing your environment like an attacker, each mirroring the techniques employed by adversaries:\\n\\nThink in graphs - While defenders often think in lists, be they of assets or vulnerabilities, attackers think in graphs, mapping out the relationships and pathways between various components of the network. Automate tests - Manual penetration testing is a costly process that involves third-party pentester stress testing your security controls. Organizations are limited in the scope they can test. In contrast, attackers leverage automation to execute attacks swiftly, efficiently and at scale. Validate real attack paths - Attackers do not focus on isolated vulnerabilities; they consider the entire attack path. Effective validation means testing the entire path, from initial access to exploited impact. Test continuously - Manual pentesting is typically done periodically, either once or twice a year, however testing in \"sprints\" or short, iterative cycles, allows defenders to adapt with the speed of IT change, protecting the entire attack surface by addressing exposures as they emerge.\\n\\nCTEM: Invest Now - Continually Reap the Results\\n\\nWith all the different elements of people, processes, and tools in a CTEM strategy, it\\'s easy to get overwhelmed. However, keep a few things in mind:\\n\\nYou\\'re not starting from scratch. You already have your asset management and your vulnerability management systems in place, the focus here is to simply extend their scope. Make sure your tools are comprehensively covering your IT environment\\'s entire attack surface and they are continually updated with the pace of change. Consider this as a process of continual refinement. Implementing the CTEM framework becomes an agile cycle of discovery, mitigation, and validation. The job is never truly done. As your enterprise grows and matures, so does your IT infrastructure. Put validation at the center of your CTEM strategy. This gives you the confidence to know that your security operations will stand up when put to the test. At any point in time, you should know where you stand. Perhaps everything checks out, which is great. Alternatively, a gap might be identified, but now you can fill that gap with a prescriptive approach, fully aware of what the downstream impact will be.\\n\\nLearn more about how to implement a validation-first CTEM strategy with Pentera.', 'Article Summary': \"The attack surface isn't what it once was and it's becoming a nightmare to protect.\\nIn 2022, a new framework was coined by Gartner to address these challenges - Continuous Threat Exposure Management (CTEM).\\nAt a second stage, consider expanding the scope to include digital risk protection, which adds greater visibility into the attack surface.\\nPillar #3 Validation Converts CTEM from theory to proven strategyThe final pillar of the CTEM strategy, validation, is the mechanism to prevent the exploitation of security gaps.\\nMake sure your tools are comprehensively covering your IT environment's entire attack surface and they are continually updated with the pace of change.\", 'Summary 2.0': 'This is a summary of the text.', 'Article Keywords': ['operation', 'attack', 'success', 'assets', 'ctem', 'scope', 'implementing', 'surface', 'organizations', 'security', 'exposures', 'management', 'blueprint', 'validation'], 'Language': 'en'}\n",

            "{'Title': 'Exploitability is the Missing Puzzle Piece of SCA (Software Composition Analysis)', 'Article Text': \"Open-source libraries allow developers to move faster, leveraging existing building blocks instead of diverting resources to building in-house. By leaning on existing open-source packages, engineers can focus on complex or bespoke elements of their products, using package managers and open-source maintainers to make it easy to pull everything together.\\n\\nHowever, you can't deny that building software using open source makes your applications more vulnerable to security risks. In an open-source library, attackers have direct access to code, and can search for current and historical vulnerabilities, as well as any issues and tickets managed on websites such as GitHub or GitLab. This helps threat actors to quickly find packages that are vulnerable and launch an attack.\\n\\nThis is where Software Composition Analysis (SCA) comes in, with the purpose of scanning packages and uncovering vulnerabilities. SCA compiles and manages a catalog of software packages, alongside details such as their versions and components, helping engineering teams to quickly identify risk.\\n\\nToday, with so many problems that can surface at the same time — it's no longer enough.\\n\\nUnderstanding the Level of Risk by Exploitability\\n\\nImagine someone giving you a list of weaknesses in your home. You have a faucet that is disconnected, and two smoke alarms that need replacing. Four of your locks aren't strong enough, in fact — one doesn't work at all. You may immediately pick up the phone to a plumber and a locksmith — as you can't live without running water, and you're worried about opening yourself up to the risk of a burglary.\\n\\nHowever, if you knew that the faucet in question was in the back yard — which you haven't used in years, and the faulty lock is on the en-suite bathroom rather than your front door, your priorities may change. In fact, if you knew that it was your kitchen that didn't have a functioning smoke alarm, voiding your insurance, that may well jump to the top of the list of priorities, and become the first problem you fix.\\n\\nThis is exactly what understanding exploitability provides in Software Composition Analysis — the visibility to recognize where you should be prioritizing efforts, and which vulnerabilities translate to business impact. If you have a library of functions and you don't use the vulnerable ones, the level of exploitability is far lower than it might first appear. If you can disable a feature so it's no longer utilized, then the vulnerability it holds is not as readily exploitable, which means it's no longer critical to fix as quickly as possible.\\n\\nPrioritization, Compliance and Urgency\\n\\nOf course, the best practice is to only use secure packages — and our recommendation will always be to upgrade unsecure components and packages. However, we also recognize that in reality, not everything can be done at once.\\n\\nMost teams have thousands of items on their to-do lists, and are continually tasked with prioritizing efforts and intelligent resource allocation. Focusing on exploitability can ensure:\\n\\nPrioritization: Where should efforts be expended first? Tempering risk with exploitability gives you the chance to be granular about when and how you should fix a weak package.\\n\\nWhere should efforts be expended first? Tempering risk with exploitability gives you the chance to be granular about when and how you should fix a weak package. Compliance: Many regulations have different requirements for critical vulnerabilities compared with what you do when facing more moderate threats. Exploitability helps teams to understand their responsibilities in terms of reporting.\\n\\nMany regulations have different requirements for critical vulnerabilities compared with what you do when facing more moderate threats. Exploitability helps teams to understand their responsibilities in terms of reporting. Relevance: In some cases, vendors determine something is weak or exploitable and there is no fix at all. Understanding exploitability lets you make an informed decision about whether you can still use it, with an accurate understanding of risk.\\n\\nUsing Exploitability Metrics to Get the Full Picture\\n\\nSo, how do developers obtain visibility into exploitability? One powerful approach is using a platform that supports metrics such as the Exploit Prediction Scoring System (EPSS). This weighs the likelihood of being exploited based on factors such as availability and vendor response. For example, if this is a new exploit without a fix, the EPSS score is very high, while an exploit that has been around for years and has a fix would score much lower. With EPSS, you can understand the temporal status of an exploit, which will be highest for widely used zero-day exploits before a fix has been found, compared with when an exploit is uncovered and disclosed by a responsible researcher for example.\\n\\nAlongside the baseline CVSS and additional metrics such as Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV), at Checkmarx we work to fine-tune exploitability so that your teams can focus attention where it's needed the most.\\n\\nTaking it further, the ability to visualize what we call the Exploitable Path flags exactly what's being used by each package, so that you can understand your immediate risk better in terms of exposure. If you're not using a vulnerable element, or your specific configuration is not vulnerable, you can prioritize elsewhere. While the best fix may still be to update or disable, you have all the information you need to manage your own risk.\\n\\nFor today's development teams, prioritization is a complex task, and competing necessities are a constant reality.

            "{'Title': '9 Customer Service Chatbots Ranked For Risk Exposure', 'Article Text': \"In today's dynamic web threat landscape, staying a step ahead of risk is crucial. Businesses want to keep improving their websites with the latest customer service experience while maintaining a strong security posture and complying with strict privacy rules. With the help of a new risk assessment tool - Exposure Rating - we have calculated the risk exposure for nine leading customer service chatbots compared against each other.\\n\\nFor the full chatbot ratings report, click here.\\n\\nBut first, what is an Exposure Rating risk assessment tool?\\n\\nContextual Risk Assessment for the Web\\n\\nExposure Rating goes beyond traditional website security solutions. It delves deeper, providing a comprehensive assessment of your web risk exposure, benchmarked against industry leaders. The rating system analyzes every website, application, and domain within your environment, giving you a clear picture of your threat landscape.\\n\\nBut Exposure Rating is more than just a report card. It's a powerful tool that guides improvement efforts. Leverage its insights to:\\n\\nIdentify and prioritize security gaps: Exposure Rating dissects your web ecosystem, pinpointing high-risk areas like applications handling sensitive data or poorly secured domains.\\n\\nExposure Rating dissects your web ecosystem, pinpointing high-risk areas like applications handling sensitive data or poorly secured domains.

Proactive threat mitigation: Exposure Rating helps you anticipate and address vulnerabilities before they become exploits.\\n\\nContext Matters: Tailored Risk Assessment\\n\\nExposure Rating doesn't operate in a vacuum. We understand that context is crucial. The same application might pose a higher risk on a checkout page than on a static informational page. Similarly, the domains an application interacts with can influence its risk score.\\n\\nProactive Improvement Simulator\\n\\nWe go beyond simply identifying risks. Our innovative simulator empowers clients to take action. It prioritizes actionable items and predicts the potential improvement in your Exposure Rating once they have been addressed. This allows you to focus on the issues that will yield the most significant security gains.\\n\\nAnalysis of the Drift Chatbot\\n\\nWe have analyzed nine customer service chatbots across various websites and industries. Importantly, Reflectiz doesn't rate the application or vendor itself, but rather the implementation of the application on a specific website. This means an application may receive two different ratings on different sites because of how they are implemented.\\n\\nFor example, as well as basic chat functionality, a chatbot might also include user-tracking capabilities. One site might implement this option, while the other doesn't. Alternatively, a chatbot's access to user inputs could expose privacy risks. Here again, the specific implementation is crucial.\\n\\nFor the full chatbot ratings report, click here.\\n\\nLet's look at Drift for example:\\n\\nAbout Drift\\n\\nDrift's customer service chatbot is a tool designed to provide immediate assistance to website visitors through conversation. It aims to deflect common support issues by offering self-service options powered by knowledge base integration and AI. This can help customers find answers faster without waiting on hold for a human representative.\\n\\nIf the chatbot can't resolve the issue, it can seamlessly transfer the conversation to a live support agent. Drift offers metrics to track the chatbot's performance, allowing businesses to optimize their customer service strategy.\\n\\nRisk Exposure Analysis\\n\\nCompared to the other chatbots we assessed, Drift got a not-so-great D grade. This graph illustrates the average risk exposure score for each vendor across the websites it's implemented on.\\n\\nFor the full chatbot ratings report, click here.\\n\\nThe chart below reveals that Drift's score varies across websites, ranging from F to C. This variation depends on the chatbot's location and implementation within each website.\\n\\nThe chart below compares Drift's specific risk factors to the other eight chatbots we have analyzed.\\n\\nDrift is tracking users' data on 50% of websites, whereas the others track users on 30% of the websites\\n\\nDrift is altering page structure on 55% of the websites, compared with 45% for the rest of the chatbots.\\n\\nThis analysis highlights the importance of assessing your customer service chatbot's implementation for potential security and privacy risks. While Drift offers valuable features like self-service options and seamless handoff to live agents, its Exposure Rating across various websites suggests a need for closer scrutiny. The report reveals that Drift's tracking and page structure alteration practices exceed industry averages, potentially impacting user privacy and website performance.\\n\\nFor the full chatbot ratings report, click here.\\n\\nSimon Arazi — VP of Product at Reflectiz\\n\\nhttps://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhuezDRKtbu7w3SUd4_gSGlRAMIqYqj2S2zggzEUTuJ5N0s10E7ieEV0jL-cbRqXO1qtSFsZOLM5MgQJwBQ-ok-BwPvUz6jtvMr4hVZ4eDAOjg1Aia3BkgVC3hNYRJ76YOsBHmfV2S8_HI8cPATwV8UsJxr_ymh7keCOH2qLqnYZ9LnJmSOonK9B8je14TX/s100-rw-e365/reflectiz.png\", 'Article Summary': \"With the help of a new risk assessment tool - Exposure Rating - we have calculated the risk exposure for nine leading customer service chatbots compared against each other.\\nBut first, what is an Exposure Rating risk assessment tool?\\nAnalysis of the Drift ChatbotWe have analyzed nine customer service chatbots across various websites and industries.\\nLet's look at Drift for example:About DriftDrift's customer service chatbot is a tool designed to provide immediate assistance to website visitors through conversation.\\nThis analysis highlights the importance of assessing your customer service chatbot's implementation for potential security and privacy risks.\", 'Summary 2.0': 'This is a summary of the text.', 'Article Keywords': ['chatbot', 'exposure', 'report', 'chatbots', 'application', 'risk', 'websites', 'rating', 'customer', 'ranked', 'service'], 'Language': 'en'}\n",

            "{'Title': 'The Democratization of Cyberattacks: How Billions of Unskilled Would-be Hackers Can Now Attack Your Organization', 'Article Text': 'Cyberattacks are already the most significant operational and financial threat to almost every type of business. Surveys of CISOs consistently reveal phishing attacks, identity security, social engineering, and the resulting data breaches and ransomware attacks are the top concerns.\\n\\nThese fears are well founded. Each new day brings fresh headlines of another major breach or successful ransomware attack. The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), an agency of the DHS reports that 90% of ransomware attacks begin with phishing. Last quarter witnessed the first individual ransomware loss that exceeded a billion dollars of damages, and a leading news media reported nine new major breaches in a single week.\\n\\nWhat is driving this epidemic and how much worse will it get?\\n\\nThe answers are both simple and complex. The simple answer is that this next generation of cyberattacks is being driven by the incredible power and innovation of generative AI, while the primary defense utilized by most organizations to stop the majority of cyberattacks is twenty-year-old multifactor authentication (MFA).\\n\\nWe will look at each of these in detail in the following.\\n\\nDigital transformation has been reshaping society for decades and the most profound changes are happening now courtesy of Generative AI. With myriad conveniences and efficiencies brought to us by technological advancements, so are perils and harm. The most significant of which is the onslaught on identity that generative AI and a new wave of cybercriminal tools will enable. The proliferation of a new generation of very powerful and user-friendly hacker tools will democratize cyberattacks enabling almost anyone with internet access to launch cyberattacks. This is compounded by the rise of the gig economy, creating an environment that will enable cybercriminal activities to be carried out by untrained individuals.\\n\\nThe franchise model comes to cybercrime\\n\\nPhishing and ransomware attacks were once the exclusive domain of highly skilled cybercriminals. With the power of generative AI and new cybercriminal tools, the ability to rapidly launch cyberattacks is now readily accessible to the masses via Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) and Generative AI tools on the dark web. These modern hacker tools remove the complexity and knowledge requirements of cyberattacks and enable almost anyone with a computer and internet access to launch an attack.\\n\\nThe process starts with skilled developers who create ransomware, which they then offer to affiliates/would-be cybercriminals for either a fee or a share of the criminal profits. Cybercriminals have developed easy-to-use platforms where affiliates can register, select their preferred ransomware package, and manage their activities. They also provide user-friendly dashboards, tools for managing attacks, the ability to track payments, and extensive \"customer support.\" The affiliate can be void of any advanced technical skills including capabilities in social engineering, phishing, or exploiting software vulnerabilities, and still instantly become a dangerous cybercriminal.\\n\\nAffiliates most often launch attacks with phishing emails that steal user login credentials. Next, they defeat the legacy MFA of the victim organization. There are more than a half dozen proven and effective ways to bypass legacy MFA including SIM-swapping, session hijacking, social engineering, MFA prompt bombing, and others. After gaining successful network access, the attacker exfiltrates sensitive data and/or encrypts the victim\\'s files, rendering them inaccessible. Ransomware payments are managed through the RaaS platform. The affiliates and developers share the ransom, most often splitting profits around 70% for affiliates and 30% for developers.\\n\\nThe Role of the Dark Web\\n\\nThe dark web has played a crucial role in the accessibility of these tools. Marketplaces on the dark web offer a variety of hacking tools and services, from simple phishing kits to sophisticated malware. These platforms operate in a manner remarkably similar to legitimate e-commerce sites. You\\'ll find user reviews, ratings, and customer support. The anonymity afforded by the dark web makes it a haven for cybercriminals to market their tools and services without fear of law enforcement. And the same goes for the attackers.\\n\\nThe number of RaaS operators has increased exponentially and competition between cybercriminals has driven down prices and increased profits for affiliates. As the tools for cyberattacks are democratized and the barriers to becoming a cybercriminal evaporate, we will see a constant increase in ransomware incidents. We are on the front edge of this and just starting to see the significant financial and operational damage to individuals and organizations that are coming.\\n\\nCybercrime in the gig economy\\n\\nThe gig economy is characterized by short-term, flexible jobs, facilitated through digital platforms. It has seen significant growth in recent years and now more than 60 million Americans are gig workers and very few don\\'t use these services in some way. We have gig-workers who shop for us in the morning, deliver food for us at lunch, and provide transportation for us in the evening.\\n\\nThe gig economy has created a massive pool of individuals who can now turn to cybercrime either out of necessity or curiosity. The accessibility of democratized hacker tools means that even those without formal training can engage in illegal cybercriminal activities anonymously, on a part-time basis, from anywhere they may be. Financial incentives and very low odds of being caught will drive large numbers of individuals toward cybercrime. Cybercriminal activities can be highly lucrative, often yielding much higher returns than legitimate gig work.\\n\\nMitigation and defense strategies\\n\\nAddressing the challenges posed by the democratization of cyberattacks requires a multi-faceted approach that includes technological and educational measures.\\n\\nOrganizations must invest in modern cybersecurity technologies to protect against the increasing volume and sophistication of attacks. This includes deploying next-generation firewalls, multifactor authentication, intrusion detection and prevention systems, and endpoint protection solutions. Additionally, the use of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) can enhance threat detection and response capabilities.\\n\\n90% of data breaches and ransomware attacks result from phishing and social engineering that steal user credentials and defeat legacy MFA. Not all MFA is created equally, and most MFA is twenty-year-old technology. There is an urgent need to implement phishing-resistant, next-generation MFA. Next-generation MFA eliminates all of the current methods that are being used to defeat legacy MFA.\\n\\nTo underscore the importance of modern MFA, a recent survey by , a renowned leadership advisory firm, researched senior security executives to gather their perspectives on MFA solutions and trends. The survey revealed that a significant majority of security leaders are aware of the limitations of legacy MFA and are actively seeking more advanced solutions to combat evolving cyber threats.\\n\\nIt\\'s simple - if cybercriminals are defeating your locks, get better locks.\\n\\nRaising awareness and educating individuals about cybersecurity is also crucial in mitigating the risks posed by untrained hackers. This includes providing training on safe online practices and how to identify the newest phishing and social engineering attacks.\\n\\nConclusion\\n\\nThe democratization of cyberattacks, fueled by the availability of easy-to-use hacking tools and the rise of the gig economy, presents significant challenges for cybersecurity. Untrained individuals now have the capability to launch sophisticated attacks, increasing the volume and complexity of threats faced by organizations. Addressing these challenges requires an upgrade to current defense technologies, most importantly legacy MFA. By adopting these strategies, we can mitigate the risks and protect against the evolving landscape of cyber threats.\\n\\nJohn Gunn — CEO and Next-Generation MFA Evangelist\\n\\nhttps://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjgWBPDJYCLklHdEV3LtOQe4CHG0p3UYFzeiPKVfMhI5RISzROxuEnnMgkVcHNVY3USAwjyIrEmGvyX6VtY79wMNFSXgep6Zi6h5gVEK-H2vlUaHRvjpSGUhTKkB8SdN_B50-5u9Ooo1Aj8Qz4pav183N_r0DMh6cjQJLd41uGBhKi2HLwuMRtuNzMlIoKH/s100-rw-e365/john.png', 'Article Summary': 'Surveys of CISOs consistently reveal phishing attacks, identity security, social engineering, and the resulting data breaches and ransomware attacks are the top concerns.\\nThe Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), an agency of the DHS reports that 90% of ransomware attacks begin with phishing.\\nNext, they defeat the legacy MFA of the victim organization.\\nNext-generation MFA eliminates all of the current methods that are being used to defeat legacy MFA.\\nAddressing these challenges requires an upgrade to current defense technologies, most importantly legacy MFA.', 'Summary 2.0': 'This is a summary of the text.', 'Article Keywords': ['attack', 'mfa', 'ransomware', 'democratization', 'attacks', 'significant', 'cybercriminals', 'legacy', 'hackers', 'billions', 'organization', 'gig', 'phishing', 'cyberattacks', 'unskilled', 'tools', 'wouldbe'], 'Language': 'en'}\n",

            "        \"Article Text\": \"Today, all organizations are exposed to the threat of cyber breaches, irrespective of their scale. Historically, larger companies were frequent targets due to their substantial resources, sensitive data, and regulatory responsibilities, whereas smaller entities often underestimated their attractiveness to hackers. However, this assumption is precarious, as cybercriminals frequently exploit perceived vulnerabilities in smaller firms for expedient profit.\\n\\nSmall to medium-sized organizations often lack the resources and expertise for robust privileged identity management. Yet they increasingly require PAM solutions. Fortunately, the market now offers numerous vendors specializing in these needs. Recognizing the demand for accessible solutions, these vendors provide affordable options tailored to organizations aiming to meet stringent compliance standards or enhance security practices, requiring minimal installation and maintenance to gain full access controls.\\n\\nTo enhance threat awareness, many organizations train employees to identify phishing attacks. Extending this proactive approach to protect corporate assets is essential. A PAM tool defends against both external and internal threats. Despite concerns about fostering a surveillance culture, the primary goal is protection.\\n\\nImplementing a PAM solution demonstrates trust in your IT team, providing a safety net to exonerate them from suspicion in case of questionable activities, proving actions were neither malicious nor their own.\\n\\nWhat does a PAM solution offer small to medium-sized organizations?\\n\\nThe following are cybersecurity functions offered by a PAM solution:\\n\\nCredential management to secure storage and management of privileged credentials, preventing insecure sharing and unauthorized access. Seamless integration simplicity, security and compliance effortlessly. Comprehensive protection to control access to critical systems and sensitive information, reducing the risk of unauthorized access. Regulatory compliance offers the necessary controls and audit trails for privileged access, helping meet stringent requirements such as GDPR, HIPAA or PCI DSS. Insider threat mitigation to minimize the risk of internal abuse or data theft.\\n\\nHow small to medium-sized organizations can simplify the implementation and management of a PAM solution?\\n\\nSmall to medium-sized organizations do not need all the complex and convoluted setup required for a traditional PAM solution. This is why One Identity developed a PAM solution that caters specifically to small to medium-sized organizations, allowing businesses of any size to utilize session monitoring and recording, logging all activities carried out with privileged accounts to facilitate forensic analysis during security incidents.\\n\\nOffering a SaaS solution ensures quick implementation, allowing organizations to establish robust privileged access management without significant delays. Additionally, this approach promotes cost-efficiency through a subscription-based model, reducing upfront costs and eliminating the need for substantial investments in hardware or dedicated personnel.\\n\\nConclusion\\n\\nDeploying a PAM solution for small to medium-sized enterprises is now straightforward. With accessible, affordable, and scalable options available, organizations can protect critical assets from external threats and insider risks effectively. By adopting proactive security measures and modern PAM technologies, these enterprises can ensure data protection, regulatory compliance, and operational continuity without undue complexity or resource strain.\",\n",

            "        \"Article Text\": \"Events like the recent massive CDK ransomware attack \\u2013 which shuttered car dealerships across the U.S. in late June 2024 \\u2013 barely raise public eyebrows anymore.\\n\\nYet businesses, and the people that lead them, are justifiably jittery. Every CISO knows that cybersecurity is an increasingly hot topic for executives and board members alike. And when the inevitable CISO/Board briefing rolls around, everyone wants answers: Are we safe from attacks? Are we making progress? Could <insert name of CVE or incident that keeps you up at night here> happen to us?\\n\\nThese are all fair concerns.\\n\\nThe question is, how do we best answer them? A company board deserves clear, concise information tied to business goals, not technical details about fixes or attack methods. A communication gap between the CISO and the board can lead to misunderstandings, increased risk, and potentially devastating cyberattacks. And this is why one of the overriding challenges for CISOs today remains: How to present risk in a way that the board can understand and leverage to make informed decisions?\\n\\nCheck out XM Cyber's new eBook, A CISO's Guide to Reporting Risk to the Board. It's packed with strategies and tips to help you finally answer board questions about risk with confidence and accuracy. By establishing a plan for clear communication and measurable progress, CISOs can finally build boardroom trust and secure the resources needed to effectively manage cyber risks.\\n\\nThe Numbers Speak\\n\\nDespite this clear and pressing need for communication, recent research by Heidrick and Struggles, leading executive search, and corporate culture consulting services, revealed a worrying disconnect between CISOs and CEOs. Only 5% of CISOs report directly to the CEO, indicating a potential lack of high-level influence, and 2\\u20443 's of CISOs are two levels down from the CEO in the reporting structure.\\n\\nThis means the majority of cybersecurity leaders remain several steps removed from organizational decision-making. The Ponemon Institute study also found that only 37% of organizations think they effectively utilize their CISO's expertise. Research from Gartner highlights a similar trend: only 10% of boards currently have a dedicated cybersecurity committee overseen by a board member.\\n\\nThese numbers expose significant weaknesses in how organizations structure reporting and how boards receive briefings. Despite a more direct role for CISOs, the challenge of translating risk into clear business terms persists.\\n\\nThe Questions\\n\\nAs a CISO, asking yourself these five key questions can help you bridge the board/executive communication gap, present a clear picture of cybersecurity posture, and gain the support needed to effectively manage risk:\\n\\n1. How do I justify my cybersecurity budget?\\n\\nCISOs understand that strong cybersecurity requires ongoing investment. Without a clear justification, your budget requests are at risk of reduction or outright rejection. So, prove that your goals are not only achievable but worthy by demonstrating the return on investment in cybersecurity. Show naysayers that by securing resources to safeguard critical data and infrastructure, you are ultimately protecting the organization's financial health.\\n\\n2. How do I master the art of risk reporting?\\n\\nMastering risk reporting is critical if you want to shift executive perception of cybersecurity. Non-technical audiences struggle with complex security threats. That's why your reports need to be clear and data-driven. They need to quantify risks in business terms, highlighting potential financial losses from breaches. This way, you demonstrate the value of security investments in protecting the organization's financial well-being \\u2013 shifting cybersecurity from a cost center to a business enabler.\\n\\n3. How do I celebrate security achievements?\\n\\nDon't focus just on problems; celebrating security wins is crucial. Recognizing your team's successes boosts organizational morale, fosters a culture of security awareness, and highlights the value of cybersecurity investments. Public recognition of attacks that were deflected can simultaneously deter attackers and reassure stakeholders of the organization's commitment to data protection.\\n\\n4. How do I collaborate with other teams better?\\n\\nEffective CISOs understand that cybersecurity isn't a solo endeavor. Strong security relies on a company-wide commitment to vigilance. That's why collaboration with other departments like IT, HR, and Legal is essential. By working together, CISOs can integrate security awareness training into employee onboarding and development programs. What's more, your collaborative efforts can lead to clearer security policies that align with business processes. And collaboration strengthens incident response protocols, ensuring a swift and coordinated response to security breaches.\\n\\n5. How do I focus on what matters most?\\n\\nCISOs are bombarded with threats and tasks. Prioritization is key. Focusing on what truly matters ensures resources are directed effectively. This means identifying the most critical security risks, aligning them with your organization's business goals, and addressing them strategically. By saying no to distractions and focusing on high-impact initiatives, you can optimize security posture and maximize your organization's overall resilience.\\n\\nBridging the Gap: Effective Communication for CISOs\\n\\nThe rising tide of cyberattacks demands clear communication between CISOs and boards. To bridge this gap and gain crucial support, CISOs should prioritize effective risk communication. Ditch the technical jargon and translate complex threats into business terms. Highlight the financial impact of cyberattacks, potential reputational damage, and disruptions to core operations. By framing cybersecurity as a business issue, CISOs can secure buy-in from the board for essential security investments. (Check out this great article for more tips on how to get executive buy-in for security initiatives here.)\\n\\nAdditionally, remember that communication goes beyond simply presenting problems. CISOs should also demonstrate progress and move away from basic metrics to develop data-driven reports that showcase the effectiveness of security investments. Key metrics should be tracked, such as reductions in successful attacks or the time taken to identify and contain breaches. These demonstrable data points will help drive your message home.\\n\\nCheck out XM Cyber's new eBook, A CISO's Guide to Reporting Risk to the Board.

            "        \"Article Text\": \"The Problem\\n\\nThe \\\"2024 Attack Intelligence Report\\\" from the staff at Rapid7 [1] is a well-researched, well-written report that is worthy of careful study. Some key takeaways are:\\n\\n53% of the over 30 new vulnerabilities that were widely exploited in 2023 and at the start of 2024 were zero-days. More mass compromise events arose from zero-day vulnerabilities than from n-day vulnerabilities. Nearly a quarter of widespread attacks were zero-day attacks where a single adversary compromised dozens to hundreds of organizations simultaneously. Attackers are moving from initial access to exploitation in minutes or hours rather than days or weeks.\\n\\nSo the conventional patch and put strategy is as effective as a firetruck showing up after a building has burned to the ground! Of course, patch and put could prevent future attacks, but taking into account that patch development takes from days to weeks [2] and that the average time to apply critical patches is 16 days [3], devices are vulnerable for a long time after the zero-day has become public knowledge. This allows smaller actors to get their share of the meat, much like the vultures they are. In view of Rapid7's report, something different must be done to protect IoT and other vulnerable devices.\\n\\nHow Firmware Comes To Be\\n\\n\\\"Software Bills of Materials for IoT and OT devices\\\" by IoTSF is another excellent read. I was surprised to learn that \\\"Modern software is rarely created from scratch but rather it integrates a relatively small amount of new code with tens, hundreds, or even thousands of pre-existing components \\u2026\\\". In the old days (circa 2015) we wrote our own firmware, but not anymore. Now, according to the authors, IoT firmware is assembled from mostly open source components that are riddled with vulnerabilities. This is not a step forward for device security!\\n\\nAccording to the IoTSF authors, components bring in more components, each with more vulnerabilities. Also according to them, creating accurate SBOMs is difficult, and identifying all of the vulnerabilities in an SBOM is even more difficult. So security teams are faced with inadequate SBOMs and the task of deciding which vulnerabilities are exploitable, then fixing those vulnerabilities. According to other reports, the number of vulnerabilities and the complexity of IoT firmware are growing rapidly year by year. Keeping up with patches seems to be a hopeless treadmill. No wonder security teams are getting burned out.\\n\\nChilling Exploits\\n\\nZero-days are especially concerning because many state actors have inventories of them that are ready to be used as weapons [4]. We tend to think of exploits as data exfiltrations or ransomware attacks. However, these are not the whole story. In 2007 at Idaho National Laboratory it was decided to test if malware could damage a full-size electricity generator [5]. The malware controlled a relay that connected or disconnected the generator from the power grid. By exercising a sequence of connects and disconnects, the malware was able to cause the generator to destroy itself.\\n\\nThe result was not repairable damage, but rather scrap metal that could only be melted down to manufacture a new generator. The generator was destroyed in under a minute. Thus malware running on a tiny MCU was able to destroy a large machine. What if a bad actor could destroy 10% of the electricity generators in the U.S.? How long would it take to manufacture and install replacement generators? What would happen in the meantime?\\n\\nWe Need a Better Solution\\n\\nWe must recognize that patching and putting is not sufficient to deal with emerging new threats and the weaponized threats detailed above.\\n\\nIsolating vulnerable firmware is the better solution. This is amply demonstrated by Green Hills's Integrity for aerospace, BlackBerry's QNX for automotive, and several \\\"separation kernels\\\" by other companies. However, the problem with these solutions is that they require power-hungry processors, and isolation is at the process level using memory management units (MMUs). IoT devices generally require low-power microcontrollers (MCUs), their firmware is normally comprised of but a single process and they are limited to memory protection units (MPUs). What is needed is more granular isolation (i.e. at the task level) that works for MCUs.\\n\\nWe Have Such a Solution\\n\\nWe have demonstrated that isolated partitioning is practical for Cortex-M based MCUs (which comprise about 80% of all MCUs in production). In addition, the pmode barrier provided by this architecture provides additional protection for mission-critical and other trusted code. Such code needs only minimal modification for partitioning. The following figure illustrates the basics of Cortex-M partitioning and how it fits into the overall security picture:\\n\\nAs shown, mission-critical firmware, security firmware, and handler mode (hmode) firmware are protected by the pmode barrier and run in privileged mode (pmode) or hmode. Vulnerable application firmware, SOUP, and middleware are above the pmode barrier and run in unprivileged mode (umode). Firmware in umode can access pmode or hmode only via exceptions caused by faults or via the SVC exception, which is used for system service calls. The pmode barrier is enforced by hardware and thus it is impenetrable from umode.\\n\\nAs shown in the figure, umode firmware is divided into isolated partitions. If a hacker penetrates one umode partition, he cannot access data or code in other partitions. Communication between partitions is via portals, which preserve isolation. As a consequence a hacker may disable the functionality of one umode partition, but not others. In addition, pmode and umode code are doubly-protected by the pmode barrier. Thus the device is able to continue performing its primary functions and most secondary functions when attacked. During an attack, the breached partition can be stopped, the malware exorcised, and the partition rebooted to resume normal operation.\\n\\nIt should be noted that isolated partitioning is as effective against zero-days as it is against unpatched vulnerabilities. It doesn't matter how the attacker got into the partition; he is sandboxed. In addition, partitioning enables siloing, which can mitigate insider threats (another growing attack vector), and provides hardware enforcement of certain good programming practices, which might lead to more on-time deliveries!\\n\\nFor those interested, we have posted demos and an ebook at www.smxrtos.com/securesmx.

            "        \"Article Text\": \"The attack surface isn't what it once was and it's becoming a nightmare to protect. A constantly expanding and evolving attack surface means risk to the business has skyrocketed and current security measures are struggling to keep it protected. If you've clicked on this article, there's a good chance you're looking for solutions to manage this risk.\\n\\nIn 2022, a new framework was coined by Gartner to address these challenges - Continuous Threat Exposure Management (CTEM). Since then, putting this framework into action has become a priority across many organizations for the profound improvement it is expected to make toward maintaining a high level of security readiness and resilience.\\n\\n\\\"By 2026 organizations that prioritize their security investments based on a continuous exposure management program will be three times less likely to suffer a breach.\\\" Gartner, \\\"How to Manage Cybersecurity Threats, Not Episodes,\\\" August 21, 2023\\n\\nCTEM provides a continuous and comprehensive view of the attack surface and the exposures within it, testing whether security controls are effectively blocking the potential exploitation of exposures, and then streamlining the mobilization towards remediating the selected vulnerabilities.\\n\\nAdopting CTEM can quickly become overwhelming as it involves the orchestration of many disparate and moving parts. Pulling together digital assets, workloads, networks, identities, and data across the enterprise. Therefore to simplify this, we have broken down the framework to its pillars, providing manageable steps that guide you through this process of making exposure management - manageable.\\n\\nPillar #1: Expand your Visibility of the Attack Surface\\n\\nA primary challenge with asset management is its limited scope. It provides only a sectioned view of the attack surface typically concentrating solely on on-premise vulnerabilities, with no scope for actioning the vulnerability data it generates.\\n\\nCTEM provides greater visibility into all types of exposures across the attack surface - internal, external, and cloud - to help organizations better understand their real security risk profile.\\n\\nThe process starts by scoping the environment for digital assets in stages. We recommend an initial scope that includes either:\\n\\nThe external attack surface, which tends to have a smaller scope and is supported by a growing ecosystem of tools. SaaS tooling, which lends itself to easier communication about risks, as SaaS solutions tend to increasingly host critical business data.\\n\\nAt a second stage, consider expanding the scope to include digital risk protection, which adds greater visibility into the attack surface.\\n\\nOnce the scope is determined, organizations should determine their risk profiles by discovering exposures on high-priority assets. It should also incorporate the misconfiguration of assets, especially as they relate to security controls, and other weaknesses, such as counterfeit assets or poor responses to phishing tests.\\n\\nPillar #2: Level up your Vulnerability Management\\n\\nVulnerability Management (VM) has long been the cornerstone of many organizations' cybersecurity strategies, focusing on identifying and patching against known CVEs. However, with the growing complexity of the IT environment and the enhanced capabilities of threat actors, VM alone is no longer enough to maintain the cybersecurity posture of the enterprise.\\n\\nThis is particularly evident when taking into account the escalating number of published CVEs each year. Last year alone, there were 29,085 CVEs and only 2-7% of these were ever exploited in the wild. This makes becoming patch-perfect an unrealistic goal, especially as this doesn't take into account non-patchable vulnerabilities such as misconfigurations, Active Directory issues, unsupported third-party software, stolen and leaked credentials and more, which will account for over 50% of enterprise exposures by 2026.\\n\\nCTEM shifts the focus to prioritizing exposures based on their exploitability and their risk impact on critical assets as opposed to CVSS scores, chronology, or vendor scoring. This ensures that the most sensitive digital assets to the organization's continuity and objectives are addressed first.\\n\\nPrioritization is therefore based on security gaps that are easily exploitable and simultaneously provide access to sensitive digital assets. The combination of both causes these exposures, which typically represent a fraction of all discovered exposures, to be prioritized.\\n\\nPillar #3 Validation Converts CTEM from theory to proven strategy\\n\\nThe final pillar of the CTEM strategy, validation, is the mechanism to prevent the exploitation of security gaps. To ensure the ongoing efficacy of security controls, validation needs to be offensive in nature, by emulating attacker methods.\\n\\nThere are four strategies for testing your environment like an attacker, each mirroring the techniques employed by adversaries:\\n\\nThink in graphs - While defenders often think in lists, be they of assets or vulnerabilities, attackers think in graphs, mapping out the relationships and pathways between various components of the network. Automate tests - Manual penetration testing is a costly process that involves third-party pentester stress testing your security controls. Organizations are limited in the scope they can test. In contrast, attackers leverage automation to execute attacks swiftly, efficiently and at scale. Validate real attack paths - Attackers do not focus on isolated vulnerabilities; they consider the entire attack path. Effective validation means testing the entire path, from initial access to exploited impact. Test continuously - Manual pentesting is typically done periodically, either once or twice a year, however testing in \\\"sprints\\\" or short, iterative cycles, allows defenders to adapt with the speed of IT change, protecting the entire attack surface by addressing exposures as they emerge.\\n\\nCTEM: Invest Now - Continually Reap the Results\\n\\nWith all the different elements of people, processes, and tools in a CTEM strategy, it's easy to get overwhelmed. However, keep a few things in mind:\\n\\nYou're not starting from scratch. You already have your asset management and your vulnerability management systems in place, the focus here is to simply extend their scope. Make sure your tools are comprehensively covering your IT environment's entire attack surface and they are continually updated with the pace of change. Consider this as a process of continual refinement. Implementing the CTEM framework becomes an agile cycle of discovery, mitigation, and validation. The job is never truly done. As your enterprise grows and matures, so does your IT infrastructure. Put validation at the center of your CTEM strategy. This gives you the confidence to know that your security operations will stand up when put to the test. At any point in time, you should know where you stand. Perhaps everything checks out, which is great. Alternatively, a gap might be identified, but now you can fill that gap with a prescriptive approach, fully aware of what the downstream impact will be.\\n\\nLearn more about how to implement a validation-first CTEM strategy with Pentera.\",\n",

            "        \"Article Text\": \"The supply chain attack targeting the widely-used Polyfill[.]io JavaScript library is broader in scope than previously thought, with new findings from Censys showing that over 380,000 hosts are embedding a polyfill script linking to the malicious domain as of July 2, 2024.\\n\\nThis includes references to \\\"https://cdn.polyfill[.]io\\\" or \\\"https://cdn.polyfill[.]com\\\" in their HTTP responses, the attack surface management firm said.\\n\\n\\\"Approximately 237,700, are located within the Hetzner network (AS24940), primarily in Germany,\\\" it noted. \\\"This is not surprising \\u2013 Hetzner is a popular web hosting service, and many website developers leverage it.\\\"\\n\\nFurther analysis of the affected hosts has revealed domains tied to prominent companies like WarnerBros, Hulu, Mercedes-Benz, and Pearson that reference the malicious endpoint in question.\\n\\nDetails of the attack emerged in late June 2024 when Sansec alerted that code hosted on the Polyfill domain had been modified to redirect users to adult- and gambling-themed websites. The code changes were made such that the redirections only took place at certain times of the day and only against visitors who met certain criteria.\\n\\nThe nefarious behavior is said to have been introduced after the domain and its associated GitHub repository were sold to a Chinese company named Funnull in February 2024.\\n\\nThe development has since prompted domain registrar Namecheap to suspend the domain, content delivery networks such as Cloudflare to automatically replace Polyfill links with domains leading to alternative safe mirror sites, and Google to block ads for sites embedding the domain.\\n\\nWhile the operators attempted to relaunch the service under a different domain named polyfill[.]com, it was also taken down by Namecheap as of June 28, 2024.

As many as 99,382 MikroTik routers are accessible over the internet.\\n\\nThese routers, besides exposing an administration interface, run on outdated versions of the operating system, making them susceptible to known security vulnerabilities in RouterOS. It's suspected that threat actors are likely weaponizing the operating system's Bandwidth test feature to pull off the attacks.\\n\\nIt's estimated that even hijacking 1% of the exposed devices into a DDoS botnet could theoretically give adversaries enough capabilities to launch layer 7 attacks reaching 2.28 billion packets per second (Gpps).\\n\\nIt bears noting at this stage that MikroTik routers have been leveraged for building potent botnets such as M\\u0113ris and even used for launching botnet-as-a-service operations.\\n\\n\\\"Depending on the number of compromised devices and their actual capabilities, this could be a new era for packet rate attacks: with botnets possibly capable of issuing billions of packets per second, it could seriously challenge how anti-DDoS infrastructures are built and scaled,\\\" Meriot said.\",\n",

It's assessed to be based in Haikou.\\n\\nIn July 2021, the U.S. and its allies officially attributed the group as affiliated with China's Ministry of State Security (MSS), indicting several members of the hacking crew for orchestrating a multiyear campaign aimed at different sectors to facilitate the theft of trade secrets, intellectual property, and high-value information.\\n\\nOver the past few years, APT40 has been linked to intrusion waves delivering the ScanBox reconnaissance framework as well as the exploitation of a security flaw in WinRAR (CVE-2023-38831, CVSS score: 7.8) as part of a phishing campaign targeting Papua New Guinea to deliver a backdoor dubbed BOXRAT.\\n\\nThen earlier this March, the New Zealand government implicated the threat actor to the compromise of the Parliamentary Counsel Office and the Parliamentary Service in 2021.\\n\\n\\\"APT40 identifies new exploits within widely used public software such as Log4j, Atlassian Confluence, and Microsoft Exchange to target the infrastructure of the associated vulnerability,\\\" the authoring agencies said.\\n\\n\\\"APT40 regularly conducts reconnaissance against networks of interest, including networks in the authoring agencies' countries, looking for opportunities to compromise its targets. This regular reconnaissance postures the group to identify vulnerable, end-of-life or no longer maintained devices on networks of interest, and to rapidly deploy exploits.\\\"\\n\\nNotable among the tradecraft employed by the state-sponsored hacking crew is the deployment of web shells to establish persistence and maintain access to the victim's environment, as well as its use of Australian websites for command-and-control (C2) purposes.\\n\\nIt has also been observed incorporating out-of-date or unpatched devices, including small-office/home-office (SOHO) routers, as part of its attack infrastructure in an attempt to reroute malicious traffic and evade detection, an operational style that is akin to that used by other China-based groups like Volt Typhoon.\\n\\nAccording to Google-owned Mandiant, this is part of a broader transition in cyber espionage activity originating from China that aims to put stealth front and center by increasingly weaponizing network edge devices, operational relay box (ORB) networks, and living-off-the-land (LotL) techniques to fly under the radar.\\n\\nAttack chains further involve carrying out reconnaissance, privilege escalation, and lateral movement activities using the remote desktop protocol (RDP) to steal credentials and exfiltrate information of interest.\\n\\nTo mitigate the risks posed by such threats, organizations are recommended to maintain adequate logging mechanisms, enforce multi-factor authentication (MFA), implement a robust patch management system, replace end-of-life equipment, disable unused services, ports, and protocols, and segment networks to prevent access to sensitive data.\",\n",

            "        \"Article Text\": \"Open-source libraries allow developers to move faster, leveraging existing building blocks instead of diverting resources to building in-house. By leaning on existing open-source packages, engineers can focus on complex or bespoke elements of their products, using package managers and open-source maintainers to make it easy to pull everything together.\\n\\nHowever, you can't deny that building software using open source makes your applications more vulnerable to security risks. In an open-source library, attackers have direct access to code, and can search for current and historical vulnerabilities, as well as any issues and tickets managed on websites such as GitHub or GitLab. This helps threat actors to quickly find packages that are vulnerable and launch an attack.\\n\\nThis is where Software Composition Analysis (SCA) comes in, with the purpose of scanning packages and uncovering vulnerabilities. SCA compiles and manages a catalog of software packages, alongside details such as their versions and components, helping engineering teams to quickly identify risk.\\n\\nToday, with so many problems that can surface at the same time \\u2014 it's no longer enough.\\n\\nUnderstanding the Level of Risk by Exploitability\\n\\nImagine someone giving you a list of weaknesses in your home. You have a faucet that is disconnected, and two smoke alarms that need replacing. Four of your locks aren't strong enough, in fact \\u2014 one doesn't work at all. You may immediately pick up the phone to a plumber and a locksmith \\u2014 as you can't live without running water, and you're worried about opening yourself up to the risk of a burglary.\\n\\nHowever, if you knew that the faucet in question was in the back yard \\u2014 which you haven't used in years, and the faulty lock is on the en-suite bathroom rather than your front door, your priorities may change. In fact, if you knew that it was your kitchen that didn't have a functioning smoke alarm, voiding your insurance, that may well jump to the top of the list of priorities, and become the first problem you fix.\\n\\nThis is exactly what understanding exploitability provides in Software Composition Analysis \\u2014 the visibility to recognize where you should be prioritizing efforts, and which vulnerabilities translate to business impact. If you have a library of functions and you don't use the vulnerable ones, the level of exploitability is far lower than it might first appear. If you can disable a feature so it's no longer utilized, then the vulnerability it holds is not as readily exploitable, which means it's no longer critical to fix as quickly as possible.\\n\\nPrioritization, Compliance and Urgency\\n\\nOf course, the best practice is to only use secure packages \\u2014 and our recommendation will always be to upgrade unsecure components and packages. However, we also recognize that in reality, not everything can be done at once.\\n\\nMost teams have thousands of items on their to-do lists, and are continually tasked with prioritizing efforts and intelligent resource allocation. Focusing on exploitability can ensure:\\n\\nPrioritization: Where should efforts be expended first? Tempering risk with exploitability gives you the chance to be granular about when and how you should fix a weak package.\\n\\nWhere should efforts be expended first? Tempering risk with exploitability gives you the chance to be granular about when and how you should fix a weak package. Compliance: Many regulations have different requirements for critical vulnerabilities compared with what you do when facing more moderate threats. Exploitability helps teams to understand their responsibilities in terms of reporting.\\n\\nMany regulations have different requirements for critical vulnerabilities compared with what you do when facing more moderate threats. Exploitability helps teams to understand their responsibilities in terms of reporting. Relevance: In some cases, vendors determine something is weak or exploitable and there is no fix at all. Understanding exploitability lets you make an informed decision about whether you can still use it, with an accurate understanding of risk.\\n\\nUsing Exploitability Metrics to Get the Full Picture\\n\\nSo, how do developers obtain visibility into exploitability? One powerful approach is using a platform that supports metrics such as the Exploit Prediction Scoring System (EPSS). This weighs the likelihood of being exploited based on factors such as availability and vendor response. For example, if this is a new exploit without a fix, the EPSS score is very high, while an exploit that has been around for years and has a fix would score much lower. With EPSS, you can understand the temporal status of an exploit, which will be highest for widely used zero-day exploits before a fix has been found, compared with when an exploit is uncovered and disclosed by a responsible researcher for example.\\n\\nAlongside the baseline CVSS and additional metrics such as Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV), at Checkmarx we work to fine-tune exploitability so that your teams can focus attention where it's needed the most.\\n\\nTaking it further, the ability to visualize what we call the Exploitable Path flags exactly what's being used by each package, so that you can understand your immediate risk better in terms of exposure. If you're not using a vulnerable element, or your specific configuration is not vulnerable, you can prioritize elsewhere. While the best fix may still be to update or disable, you have all the information you need to manage your own risk.\\n\\nFor today's development teams, prioritization is a complex task, and competing necessities are a constant reality. At Checkmarx, we take SCA further than a simple catalog of packages and vulnerabilities, and provide the essential insight and visibility into whether a vulnerability is exploitable in your environment.\\n\\nFor a deeper dive into how exploitability analysis can optimize your remediation efforts, download the FREE Tolly Report commissioned by Checkmarx, a global leader in application security testing.

This allows you to focus on the issues that will yield the most significant security gains.\\n\\nAnalysis of the Drift Chatbot\\n\\nWe have analyzed nine customer service chatbots across various websites and industries. Importantly, Reflectiz doesn't rate the application or vendor itself, but rather the implementation of the application on a specific website. This means an application may receive two different ratings on different sites because of how they are implemented.\\n\\nFor example, as well as basic chat functionality, a chatbot might also include user-tracking capabilities. One site might implement this option, while the other doesn't. Alternatively, a chatbot's access to user inputs could expose privacy risks. Here again, the specific implementation is crucial.\\n\\nFor the full chatbot ratings report, click here.\\n\\nLet's look at Drift for example:\\n\\nAbout Drift\\n\\nDrift's customer service chatbot is a tool designed to provide immediate assistance to website visitors through conversation. It aims to deflect common support issues by offering self-service options powered by knowledge base integration and AI. This can help customers find answers faster without waiting on hold for a human representative.\\n\\nIf the chatbot can't resolve the issue, it can seamlessly transfer the conversation to a live support agent. Drift offers metrics to track the chatbot's performance, allowing businesses to optimize their customer service strategy.\\n\\nRisk Exposure Analysis\\n\\nCompared to the other chatbots we assessed, Drift got a not-so-great D grade. This graph illustrates the average risk exposure score for each vendor across the websites it's implemented on.\\n\\nFor the full chatbot ratings report, click here.\\n\\nThe chart below reveals that Drift's score varies across websites, ranging from F to C. This variation depends on the chatbot's location and implementation within each website.\\n\\nThe chart below compares Drift's specific risk factors to the other eight chatbots we have analyzed.\\n\\nDrift is tracking users' data on 50% of websites, whereas the others track users on 30% of the websites\\n\\nDrift is altering page structure on 55% of the websites, compared with 45% for the rest of the chatbots.\\n\\nThis analysis highlights the importance of assessing your customer service chatbot's implementation for potential security and privacy risks. While Drift offers valuable features like self-service options and seamless handoff to live agents, its Exposure Rating across various websites suggests a need for closer scrutiny. The report reveals that Drift's tracking and page structure alteration practices exceed industry averages, potentially impacting user privacy and website performance.\\n\\nFor the full chatbot ratings report, click here.\\n\\nSimon Arazi \\u2014 VP of Product at Reflectiz\\n\\nhttps://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhuezDRKtbu7w3SUd4_gSGlRAMIqYqj2S2zggzEUTuJ5N0s10E7ieEV0jL-cbRqXO1qtSFsZOLM5MgQJwBQ-ok-BwPvUz6jtvMr4hVZ4eDAOjg1Aia3BkgVC3hNYRJ76YOsBHmfV2S8_HI8cPATwV8UsJxr_ymh7keCOH2qLqnYZ9LnJmSOonK9B8je14TX/s100-rw-e365/reflectiz.png\",\n",

            "        \"Title\": \"The Democratization of Cyberattacks: How Billions of Unskilled Would-be Hackers Can Now Attack Your Organization\",\n",
            "        \"Article Text\": \"Cyberattacks are already the most significant operational and financial threat to almost every type of business. Surveys of CISOs consistently reveal phishing attacks, identity security, social engineering, and the resulting data breaches and ransomware attacks are the top concerns.\\n\\nThese fears are well founded. Each new day brings fresh headlines of another major breach or successful ransomware attack. The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), an agency of the DHS reports that 90% of ransomware attacks begin with phishing. Last quarter witnessed the first individual ransomware loss that exceeded a billion dollars of damages, and a leading news media reported nine new major breaches in a single week.\\n\\nWhat is driving this epidemic and how much worse will it get?\\n\\nThe answers are both simple and complex. The simple answer is that this next generation of cyberattacks is being driven by the incredible power and innovation of generative AI, while the primary defense utilized by most organizations to stop the majority of cyberattacks is twenty-year-old multifactor authentication (MFA).\\n\\nWe will look at each of these in detail in the following.\\n\\nDigital transformation has been reshaping society for decades and the most profound changes are happening now courtesy of Generative AI. With myriad conveniences and efficiencies brought to us by technological advancements, so are perils and harm. The most significant of which is the onslaught on identity that generative AI and a new wave of cybercriminal tools will enable. The proliferation of a new generation of very powerful and user-friendly hacker tools will democratize cyberattacks enabling almost anyone with internet access to launch cyberattacks. This is compounded by the rise of the gig economy, creating an environment that will enable cybercriminal activities to be carried out by untrained individuals.\\n\\nThe franchise model comes to cybercrime\\n\\nPhishing and ransomware attacks were once the exclusive domain of highly skilled cybercriminals. With the power of generative AI and new cybercriminal tools, the ability to rapidly launch cyberattacks is now readily accessible to the masses via Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) and Generative AI tools on the dark web. These modern hacker tools remove the complexity and knowledge requirements of cyberattacks and enable almost anyone with a computer and internet access to launch an attack.\\n\\nThe process starts with skilled developers who create ransomware, which they then offer to affiliates/would-be cybercriminals for either a fee or a share of the criminal profits. Cybercriminals have developed easy-to-use platforms where affiliates can register, select their preferred ransomware package, and manage their activities. They also provide user-friendly dashboards, tools for managing attacks, the ability to track payments, and extensive \\\"customer support.\\\" The affiliate can be void of any advanced technical skills including capabilities in social engineering, phishing, or exploiting software vulnerabilities, and still instantly become a dangerous cybercriminal.\\n\\nAffiliates most often launch attacks with phishing emails that steal user login credentials. Next, they defeat the legacy MFA of the victim organization. There are more than a half dozen proven and effective ways to bypass legacy MFA including SIM-swapping, session hijacking, social engineering, MFA prompt bombing, and others. After gaining successful network access, the attacker exfiltrates sensitive data and/or encrypts the victim's files, rendering them inaccessible. Ransomware payments are managed through the RaaS platform. The affiliates and developers share the ransom, most often splitting profits around 70% for affiliates and 30% for developers.\\n\\nThe Role of the Dark Web\\n\\nThe dark web has played a crucial role in the accessibility of these tools. Marketplaces on the dark web offer a variety of hacking tools and services, from simple phishing kits to sophisticated malware. These platforms operate in a manner remarkably similar to legitimate e-commerce sites. You'll find user reviews, ratings, and customer support. The anonymity afforded by the dark web makes it a haven for cybercriminals to market their tools and services without fear of law enforcement. And the same goes for the attackers.\\n\\nThe number of RaaS operators has increased exponentially and competition between cybercriminals has driven down prices and increased profits for affiliates. As the tools for cyberattacks are democratized and the barriers to becoming a cybercriminal evaporate, we will see a constant increase in ransomware incidents. We are on the front edge of this and just starting to see the significant financial and operational damage to individuals and organizations that are coming.\\n\\nCybercrime in the gig economy\\n\\nThe gig economy is characterized by short-term, flexible jobs, facilitated through digital platforms. It has seen significant growth in recent years and now more than 60 million Americans are gig workers and very few don't use these services in some way. We have gig-workers who shop for us in the morning, deliver food for us at lunch, and provide transportation for us in the evening.\\n\\nThe gig economy has created a massive pool of individuals who can now turn to cybercrime either out of necessity or curiosity. The accessibility of democratized hacker tools means that even those without formal training can engage in illegal cybercriminal activities anonymously, on a part-time basis, from anywhere they may be. Financial incentives and very low odds of being caught will drive large numbers of individuals toward cybercrime. Cybercriminal activities can be highly lucrative, often yielding much higher returns than legitimate gig work.\\n\\nMitigation and defense strategies\\n\\nAddressing the challenges posed by the democratization of cyberattacks requires a multi-faceted approach that includes technological and educational measures.\\n\\nOrganizations must invest in modern cybersecurity technologies to protect against the increasing volume and sophistication of attacks. This includes deploying next-generation firewalls, multifactor authentication, intrusion detection and prevention systems, and endpoint protection solutions. Additionally, the use of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) can enhance threat detection and response capabilities.\\n\\n90% of data breaches and ransomware attacks result from phishing and social engineering that steal user credentials and defeat legacy MFA. Not all MFA is created equally, and most MFA is twenty-year-old technology. There is an urgent need to implement phishing-resistant, next-generation MFA. Next-generation MFA eliminates all of the current methods that are being used to defeat legacy MFA.\\n\\nTo underscore the importance of modern MFA, a recent survey by , a renowned leadership advisory firm, researched senior security executives to gather their perspectives on MFA solutions and trends. The survey revealed that a significant majority of security leaders are aware of the limitations of legacy MFA and are actively seeking more advanced solutions to combat evolving cyber threats.\\n\\nIt's simple - if cybercriminals are defeating your locks, get better locks.\\n\\nRaising awareness and educating individuals about cybersecurity is also crucial in mitigating the risks posed by untrained hackers. This includes providing training on safe online practices and how to identify the newest phishing and social engineering attacks.\\n\\nConclusion\\n\\nThe democratization of cyberattacks, fueled by the availability of easy-to-use hacking tools and the rise of the gig economy, presents significant challenges for cybersecurity. Untrained individuals now have the capability to launch sophisticated attacks, increasing the volume and complexity of threats faced by organizations. Addressing these challenges requires an upgrade to current defense technologies, most importantly legacy MFA. By adopting these strategies, we can mitigate the risks and protect against the evolving landscape of cyber threats.\\n\\nJohn Gunn \\u2014 CEO and Next-Generation MFA Evangelist\\n\\nhttps://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjgWBPDJYCLklHdEV3LtOQe4CHG0p3UYFzeiPKVfMhI5RISzROxuEnnMgkVcHNVY3USAwjyIrEmGvyX6VtY79wMNFSXgep6Zi6h5gVEK-H2vlUaHRvjpSGUhTKkB8SdN_B50-5u9Ooo1Aj8Qz4pav183N_r0DMh6cjQJLd41uGBhKi2HLwuMRtuNzMlIoKH/s100-rw-e365/john.png\",\n",

Players use swords, daggers, maces, and magic spells to battle enemies in frenetic combat. Battles are highlighted by impact sounds, colorful light effects, and brief explosions. Some enemies burst into large, yellow droplets when defeated and/or leave green stains on the ground.
